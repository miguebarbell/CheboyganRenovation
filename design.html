			<h2>Design - 2020-2021 Phase</h2>
				<h3>Kitchen</h3>
				<img src="images/KitchenCabinetsCircuits1.pdf" alt="Kitchen cabinets and circuits on south-facing wall.">
				<p>The side entry door on house's west face  has been replaced with a sliding doorwall and the cabinets will be reconfigured into a galley layout. The Mouser cabinets, trim, and moldings are knotty alder of a simple Shaker style and finished in clear natural stain.</p>
				<p>The galley kitchen configuration makes possible a larger doorwall that opens the room to the outdoors. The galley configuration also eliminates cabinets with blind corners that are prone to forgotten, buried storage items, and lazy susans that can become unbalanced or broken after several years of use.</p>
				<p>A durable engineered wood, 5" plank, floated flooring with white oak veneer will be installed throughout the kitchen. The engineered wood flooring will be extended into the dining room and living room in future construction phases - most likely 2021-2022. The wood flooring will further contribute to the warm tones set by the alder cabinets.</p>
				<p>A tossed marble tile will be used for the kitchen backsplash. The backsplash has a color similar to the sand found out front of the house and on nearby Bliss Beach and Waugoshance Point on Lake Michigan.</p>
				<img src="images/KitchenCabinetsCircuits2.pdf" alt="Kitchen cabinets and circuits on south-facing wall.">
				<p>The kitchen window on the house's north face  has been replaced with a larger, 3-window combination (one large awning and two flanking casements not shown in this rendering). The Mouser cabinets, trim, and moldings continue through the kitchen. The large window and doorwall will open the house to views of Lake Huron as well as the sidelot where Aunt Kathleen and Uncle George's cabin use to stand.</p>
				<p>The Mouser cabinets have solid plywood interiors that should last for decades. The knotty alder cabinet fronts with inset drawers and doors will amber into a richer color over the years taking on a hue similar to the original knotty pine that was used throughout the original cabin.</p>
				<p>Unfortunatley, most of the original pine v-paneling in the kitchen was not recoverable. However, several boards from the original construction in the 1940's were salvaged and might be re-used in future phases.</p>
				<p>In recent years, with less annual snowfall providing less protection to deeper cold freezes and temperature swings, the Cheboygan house has had to be winterized from November through March. With the current year construction plan, the kitchen plumbing has been re-worked to make the house usable in the winter. The new plumbing also allows for the placement of a sink disposal which will support a healthier septic system.</p>
				<h3>Front Bathroom</h3>
				<img src="images/BathroomVanityWall.pdf" alt="New vanity, medicine cabinet, fixtures, and built-in shelf in front bathroom.">
				<p>The front bathroom will be completely renovated. The room was stripped down to the frame walls and the slab floor was removed. A trench was opened up between the bathroom and the kitchen in order to connect the kitchen drain to the house septic line, and to move the house plumbing off exterior walls where they were susceptible to freezing and where they will now be more protected either underground, in interior walls or in re-built frame walls in the kitchen and bathroom where they can be properly insulated.</p>
				<p>A new vanity of shallower depth with wall fixtures will be installed. The shallower depth of the free-standing vanity allowed the door opening to be re-positioned and reconfigured as a pocket door. The pocket door and vanity will make the room more open and easier for adults and children to enter and move about the room. The built-in shelves were replaced to be more usable from the bathroom vanity. The new shelves are open and begin at 36" above the floor and extend to the ceiling. A false wall was installed below and behind the shelves to prevent dropped articles from getting lost or items pushed back out of sight, and to make cleaning generally easier.</p>
				<p>Not shown is the new tub and tiling. The black and white tiles around the tub combined with black and white basketweave floor tiles and chrome fixtures will give the room a vintage appearance reminiscent of the Asbury Park Detroit house.</p>
				<h3>Open Layout and Next Phase</h3>
				<img src="images/KitchenDiningLivingRoomTop.pdf" alt="Open layout of kitchen, dining and living rooms.">
				<p>This top view shows how the kitchen has been re-configured to open up more to the outdoors through the doorwall and enlarged kitchen window. It also connects with the living room as well as the dining room by removing the peninsula and overhead cabinetry.</p>
				<p> In a future phase, the living room entrance door will be covered and a new doorwall at the front of the living room will be installed that will open onto a new deck. New larger windows will also be installed in the Living Room.</p>
				<p>Great Great Grandpa Frost built the original cabin with a large picture window looking out onto Lake Huron. According to Grandpa Castle, his grandfather, a retired Detroit Mounted policeman and former soldier stationed at Fort Mackinac, referred to the breaking waves as "dancing white horses". Grandma and Grandpa Castle would peacefully look out onto the lake with a cup of tea or coffee, and Grandma Castle especially enjoyed watching the hummingbirds at the feeder outside her living room window. The new windows, doorwall and deck will move the next generations, during their stays, even closer to the outdoors and the Straits of Mackinac.</p>
