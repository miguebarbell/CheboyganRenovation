                            <h2>Kitchen Appliance Wall (South)</h2>
                            <p>The side entry door on house's west face  has been replaced with a sliding doorwall and the cabinets will be reconfigured into a galley with wide aisle layout. The Mouser cabinets, trim, and moldings are knotty alder of a simple Shaker style and finished in clear natural stain.</p>
                            <div id="desKit-1" class="collapse">
                                <p>The galley kitchen configuration makes possible a larger doorwall that opens the room to the outdoors. The galley configuration also eliminates cabinets with blind corners that are prone to forgotten, buried storage items, and lazy susans that can become unbalanced or broken after several years of use.</p>
                                <p>A durable engineered wood, 5" plank, floated flooring with white oak veneer will be installed throughout the kitchen. The engineered wood flooring will be extended into the dining room and living room in future construction phases - most likely 2021-2022. The wood flooring will further contribute to the warm tones set by the alder cabinets.</p>
                                <p>A tossed marble tile will be used for the kitchen backsplash. The backsplash has a color similar to the sand found out front of the house and on nearby Bliss Beach and Waugoshance Point on Lake Michigan.</p>

                            <p>The kitchen window on the house's north face  has been replaced with a larger, 3-window combination (one large awning and two flanking casements not shown in this rendering). The Mouser cabinets, trim, and moldings continue through the kitchen. The large window and doorwall will open the house to views of Lake Huron as well as the sidelot where Aunt Kathleen and Uncle George's cabin use to stand.</p>
                            <div id="desKit-2" class="collapse">
                                <p>The Mouser cabinets have solid plywood interiors that should last for decades. The knotty alder cabinet fronts with inset drawers and doors will amber into a richer color over the years taking on a hue similar to the original knotty pine that was used throughout the original cabin.</p>
                                <p>Unfortunately, most of the original pine v-groove paneling in the kitchen was not recoverable. However, several boards from the original construction in the 1940's were salvaged from the dining room and might be re-used in future phases.</p>
                                <p>In recent years, with less annual snowfall providing less protection to deeper cold freezes and temperature swings, the Cheboygan house has had to be winterized from November through March. With the current year construction plan, the kitchen plumbing has been re-worked to make the house usable in the winter. The new plumbing also allows for the placement of a sink disposal which will support a healthier septic system.</p>

                            <p>The front bathroom will be completely renovated. The room was stripped down to the frame walls and the slab floor was removed. A trench was opened up between the bathroom and the kitchen in order to connect the kitchen drain to the house septic line, and to move the house plumbing off exterior walls where they were susceptible to freezing and where they will now be more protected either underground, in interior walls or in re-built frame walls in the kitchen and bathroom where they can be properly insulated.</p>
                            <div id="desBath" class="collapse">
                                <p>A new vanity of shallower depth with wall fixtures will be installed. The shallower depth of the free-standing vanity allowed the door opening to be re-positioned and reconfigured as a pocket door. The pocket door and vanity will make the room more open and easier for adults and children to enter and move about the room. The built-in shelves were replaced to be more usable from the bathroom vanity. The new shelves are open and begin at 36" above the floor and extend to the ceiling. A false wall was installed below and behind the shelves to prevent dropped articles from getting lost or items pushed back out of sight, and to make cleaning generally easier.</p>
                                <p>Not shown is the new tub and tiling. The black and white tiles around the tub combined with black and white basketweave floor tiles and chrome fixtures will give the room a vintage appearance reminiscent of the Asbury Park Detroit house.</p>

                            <p>This top view shows how the kitchen has been re-configured to open up more to the outdoors through the doorwall and enlarged kitchen window. It also connects with the living room as well as the dining room by removing the peninsula and overhead cabinetry.</p>

                                <p> In a future phase, most likely in Fall 2021-Winter2022, the living room entrance door will be covered and a new doorwall at the front of the living room will be installed that will open onto a new deck. New larger windows will also be installed in the Living Room.</p>
                                <p>Great Great Grandpa Frost built the original cabin with a large picture window looking out onto Lake Huron. According to Grandpa Castle, his grandfather, a retired Detroit Mounted policeman and former soldier stationed at Fort Mackinac, enjoyed days when the wind would blow on the Straits and would refer to the breaking waves as "dancing white horses". Grandma and Grandpa Castle would peacefully look out onto the lake with a cup of tea or coffee, and Grandma Castle especially enjoyed watching the hummingbirds at the feeder outside her living room window. The new windows, doorwall and deck will move the next generations, during their visits to Northern Michigan, even closer to the outdoors and the Straits of Mackinac.</p>

                            <p>Beginning in January 2022, remodeling work will resume with a focus on the living and dining rooms. The existing carpeting, paneling and suspended ceiling in the living room will be removed. The dining room carpeting will also be removed.</p>
                            <div id="desNorthWall" class="collapse">
                                <p> New replacement windows have been designed and ordered for all three walls in the living room. The wood flooring in the kitchen will be extended throughout the living and dining rooms. Drywall will be installed on the walls and ceiling.  Knotty alder trim will be installed throughout the lving and dining rooms.</p>
                                <p> This drawing shows hows the two existing windows on the North living room wall that look onto the lake will be replaced with a single, larger composite window. The new window is shown in bright blue outline, and the old window locations are shown as shaded, salmon colored boxes.</p>
                                <p> As can be seen in the design diagram, the new composite window is comprised of a large picture window flanked by two casement windows. The new window opening is taller (five feet high) and wider (ten feet wide) allowing for more expansive and uninterrupted views of the property frontage, lake and islands.</p>

                            <h2>2021-2022 Living Room East Wall Window Design</h2>
                            <p>The East wall that points towards Cheboygan will receive a facelift. This wall previously had a single 48" x 48" sliding window. This window will be replaced with a 48" x 48" casement window. A second 48" x 48" window will be added to this wall.</p>
                            <div id="desEastWall" class="collapse">
                                <p> The second window will bring more of the outdoors into the room. Airflow from the outdoors will be increased by replacing slider windows with casement windows. A double casement window like these, when fully opened, has twice the airflow of a slider window of the same rough opening size.</p>
                                <p> As can be seen in this drawing, there is open wall space between the two new matching windows that can be used for wall hangings or an entertainment area. All of the new windows in this room will be trimmed in knotty alder wood like the new kitchen window, doorwall and cabinets that were installed in 2021.</p>
                                <p>Space has been left in the corner of the rooms for lamps to provide lighting. There will also be new recessed lighting installed in the ceiling to provide general lighting. Removal of the suspended ceiling will increase the ceiling height by 2-3 inches. The additional windows, increased ceiling height, and recessed lighting will have the overall effect of making the room lighter and airier during the day and as well as at night.</p>

                            <h2>2021-2022 Living Room West Wall Window Design</h2>
                            <p>Its not clear why Grandpa and Grandma Castle included an exterior door into the living room addition they built in the 1970's. They may have had future plans to wall off the kitchen door to add storage and working space, leaving the living room door for access to the side yard and beach frontage.</p>
                            <div id="desWestWall" class="collapse">
                                <p>However, the second building addition to the house in the mid-eighties added the master bedroom and craftroom and created two additional entrances into the house. As a result, the living room door has received little use for several years. In the new design, the door has been removed and replaced with wall space. This new wall space will be ideal for wall hangings, TV, or as a potential location for a gas or wood-burning stove someday in the future.</p>
                                <p>With the removal of the door, a second composite picture window will be added to the room on the West wall. This window, like the North wall window, also has a large picture window flanked by two casement windows. And like the North window, it is is five feet high -- although it isn't quite as wide, measuring in at 8 feet. The existing outdoor stair railing is an obstruction to the view that will be removed this year.</p>
                                <p>This new window will dramatically open views onto the side lot where Aunt Kathleen's cottage used to stand. As some of the "olds" might remember, the Gignac cottage used to be nestled among many fine cedar and birch specimens. In the coming years we hope to design and plant new landscaping in this area with trees to replace the many trees that have fallen in the last 10-15 years.</p>
