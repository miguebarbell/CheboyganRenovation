			<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<h3>History</h3>
					<p>The Castle family has owned the Cheboygan home along the shores of Lake Huron since the late 1940's when Thomas Frost bought the double lot between Cheboygan and Mackinaw City shortly after World War II. The lot and the house have changed hands but always remained in the family.</p>
				<h3>Future</h3>
					<p>In 2020, Gerry Castle's surviving siblings decided to invest funds from his estate into re-modeling the Cheboygan house. After purchasing the house and property from his parent's estate, Gerry had expressed his plans, on several occasions, to fix up the Cheboygan house and make it a place to where his extended family could return. In honor of his wishes and in memory of Gerry and other family members who are no longer with us, the house will be renovated for the enjoyment of future generations.</p>

			<h2>House Re-model Project</h2>
				<h3>Multiple Phases</h3>
					<p>The scope of the project is to re-model every room in the house - only the garage and attic will be left undisturbed. Additionally, a large deck will be extended off the front of the house facing the lake. New plantings will be landscaped around the house, and saplings will be planted throughout the property replacing the many trees that have fallen over the last decade.</p>
					<p>Home improvements will be undertaken with a goal of simplifying and extending the maintainability of the home. Another goal of the renovations is to make the house and property more attractive and comfortable as a vacation getaway for our family's next generations.</p>
					<p> Renovation and re-modeling work will be broken into distinct phases spanning multiple years. Construction will occur during the late fall and through the winter months, thus leaving the house available for use and enjoyment during the spring, summer, and fall color seasons.</p>
				<h3>2020-2021 Construction Scope</h3>
					<p>Construction for the first annual phase of the project began in Late October 2020 and is expected to finish in March 2021. The scope of this year's project is to complete the following: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Demo the kitchen, dining room, and front bathroom to unfinished walls</li>
