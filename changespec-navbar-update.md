## Design Page Updates

### NavBar Pulldowns by Year

- Update NavBar so that Design and Progress selections provide option for year: 2021 and 2022.
- This will require a new file-folder structure:
```
  /index.html
  /calendar.html
  /design
    /2021/design.html
    /2022/design.html
  /progress
    /2021/progress.html
    /2022/progress.html
```
- Design and Progress NavBar pulldowns should offer the user a choice for 2021 and 2022
- html files in the 2021 and 2022 folders should only show cards for that specific year.
