					<h3>Exterior View of New Kitchen Doorwall and Window</h3>
					<img src="images/IMG_7305.jpg" alt="Exterior view of new kitchen doorwall and window.">
					<p>A new doorwall and window combination has been installed in the kitchen that will open the indoors to the outdoors. The new, combination kitchen window is similar in layout to the three-section picture window on the original cabin's front wall that looked out and onto Lake Huron and Bois Blanc Island. The new windows will allow plenty of Northern summer light to enter the kitchen along with fresh breezes and sounds from the Straits of Mackinac.</p>
					<p>This photo was taken on January 7, 2021. It was a very sunny day, and as I walked through the kitchen and dining room, the increased natural light that came into the rooms was noticeable. There was 1-2 inches of snow on the ground with patches of grass here and there.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="fullview two">

					<h3>New Interior Framewall for Kitchen</h3>
					<img src="images/IMG_7292.jpg" alt="Kitchen combination window - interior view.">
					<p>In addition to the the new doorwall and combination window, a new framewall was constructed in the kitchen interior. The original house wall is concealed behind the drywall - however, it is constructed of upright pine timbers. It served as both the exterior siding and as the frame of the house on which pine v-groove paneling was fastened. Originally, house wires to outlets and switches were exposed on the cabin walls prior to the remodels and renovations that were undertaken in the 1970's and 80's. The new 2x4" framewall in the kitchen has been built alongside the original house wall timbers. This new framewall provides a larger, structured space to run plumbing and electrical inside the wall as well as to spray foam insulation.</p>

					<h3>From Summer Cabin to Four Season House</h3>
					<img src="images/IMG_7258.jpg" alt="Kitchen doorwall interior view.">
					<p>Although structural improvements are being made on the older part of the house, one should not assume that the original construction and subsequent renovations were somehow inferior in craftsmanship or poorly designed. One must keep in mind that the Cheboygan house was built and renovated for different uses, under different circumstances, and with limited resources and ever changing availability of technology.</p>
					<p>When Great-great Grandpa Frost originally built the house, access to Northern Michigan for winter vacation visitors was very limited. At the time of the cabin's original construction, I-75 and the US interstate highway system did not exist. And so, the cabin was only built for use from late spring, summer, and early fall use.</p>
					<p>Grandpa and Grandma Castle built additions and made renovations that transformed the cabin into a home. They made these improvements while occupying the house. This greatly complicated the timing, scale, and cost of the construction that could be reasonably managed while maintaining a livable space.</p>
					<p>Despite the many measures that Grandma and Grandpa Castle took to insulate the house from the cold Northern winters, they could not have predicted recent climate trends of less snow and more extreme temperature fluctuations in the Cheboygan area that have made the house more susceptible to pipe-freezing and damage.</p>
					<p>Although Great-great Grandpa's Frost's original cabin was built for limited, warm weather use, this year's renovations will make the house a true year-round living space.</p>

					<h3>Front Bathroom - New Walls and Door Opening</h3>
					<img src="images/BathroomDemo.jpg" alt="Bathroom demolition including wall removal.">
					<p>This is a photo of the front bathroom demolition. This photo shows that the bathroom interior wall to the hallway has been removed. It will be replaced with a new wall with a pocket door. The bathroom door opening will be re-positioned so that a 28" solid-core, sliding door can be installed. The sliding door will create more room around the bath and allow privacy.</p>
					<p>This bathroom sits on the cement slab of the original cabin. Great-great Grandpa Frost's cabin consisted of five rooms and a sleeping porch. The five rooms were the kitchen, two bedrooms, one bathroom, and the dining room.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="fullview five">
					<br>
					<h3>Front Bathroom - Slab Removal</h3>
					<img src="images/BathroomSlabRemoval.jpg" alt="Bathroom cement slab removed for new plumbing.">
					<p>Similar to the kitchen the front bathroom was stripped down to the exterior walls. The original exterior walls are the upright timbers behind the new 2x4" frame walls. The cement slab was also removed to allow new interior drainlines to be installed between the kitchen and the bathroom and the house septic line.</p>
					<p>Originally, there was an exterior window in the bathroom. A large claw-footed, cast iron tub use to sit by the window. The tub access was not very friendly for young chidren or older adults. The tub was removed and the window was covered up when the bathroom received its first remodeling in the 1970's. The frame for the window opening can be seen in the photo.</p>
					<p>The original window will remain covered and the free-standing tub will not return. The sink, toilet, and tub placement will not substantially change from the previous configuration. However, the tub and vanity will be replaced. The new tub is cast iron with easy step-in for young and old alike, and the surrounding tilework will have a simple, classic black and white scheme.</p>

					<h3>Trench for Plumbing Between Kitchen and Bathroom</h3>
					<img src="images/BathroomKitchenTrench.jpg" alt="Trench between bathroom and kitchen for new plumbing.">
					<p>A jackhammer has been used to remove the bathroom slab floor and to make a trench between the kitchen and the bathroom. New plumbing will be routed beneath the replaced slab with drain lines laid with sufficient pitch to the house septic line.</p>
					<p>The new plumbing replaces hot and cold feed lines that were previously routed along the exterior walls of the house. The old lines were especially prone to winter freezing. In recent years, the lack of snow made the house vulnerable to "Artic Clippers" where frigid temperatures combined with strong winds penetrated their way through house crevices and froze plumbing. The new buried lines will be better protected from this kind of winter freezing.</p>
					<p>An added benefit of the new plumbing connection between the kitchen drain and the house septic system, is that a disposal can be installed. Disposal of food scraps in the kitchen sink will create a healthier and more efficient microbial environment in the house septic system.</p>					
					<p>Between the bathroom and the well room in the garage, plex tube plumbing will be routed through interior walls.</p>

				<div class="fullview seven">

					<h3>New Bathroom Entrance Wall</h3>
					<img src="images/IMG_7260.jpg" alt="Drywalled bathroom entrance.">
					<p>The pocket door entrance into the bathroom has been drywalled and painted. It still needs finish trimming. The entrance has been shifted to the right in order to fit a 28" door. The sliding door will be a simple, Shaker styled, 2-panel door. As rooms are finished in the coming years, the existing slab doors will be replaced with similarly styled, 2-panel doors.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="fullview eight">

					<h3>Bathtub Stall and Adjacent Toiletries Cubby</h3>
					<img src="images/IMG_7279.jpg" alt="Drywalled bathroom tub stall and cubby.">
					<p>This closeup photo of the bathroom interior shows the tub stall and the adjacent cubby. This cubby is adjacent to the vanity as well as the tub. It will hold shelves that match the vanity and can be used by visitors to hold their toiletries.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="fullview nine">
					<br>
					<h3>Dining Room and Kitchen Drywall</h3>
					<img src="images/IMG_7291.jpg" alt="Dining Room and Kitchen Drywalled.">
					<p>This is a view from the kitchen doorwall into the dining room and the kitchen. The rooms have been drywalled and painted. The new kitchen ceiling blends into the existing dining room ceiling. A new coat of matching white flat paint has been applied to the ceilings of both rooms. Recessed light cutouts, electrical and cans will be installed in January.</p>
